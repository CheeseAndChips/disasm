## 8086 disassembler
8086 disassembler, written in 8086 assembly. <br/>
Uses NASM syntax, so yasm/nasm assembler is needed. <br/>
Includes a `BIG.COM` file for testing, with `BIG.TXT` being the needed result.

Compilation: <br/>
`cl.bat` can be used to compile. `rlarge.bat` compiles for diff comparison (so that CS matches that given in the example result) and runs on `BIG.COM`.
